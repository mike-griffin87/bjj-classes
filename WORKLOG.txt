Version: 0.9.0
Date: 2025-12-23
Branch: feature-Drilling-hours

Drilling Feature - Initial Implementation:
- Added Class/Drilling mode toggle at top of Add Class drawer (full-width segmented control)
- Drilling mode UI includes: date (defaults today), description, hours, location (Home/Gym toggle), style (Gi/NoGi)
- Class mode remains unchanged with full form
- Unified form spacing to 24px for consistency
- Fixed controlled/uncontrolled input warnings
- Drilling submissions marked with `classType: 'Drilling'` and include `drillingLocation` field
- Instructor field excluded from drilling submissions to prevent unintended defaults

Next steps:
- Display drillingLocation in class table/dashboard
- Persist drillingLocation in database schema if needed
- Consider UI refinements based on user feedback
