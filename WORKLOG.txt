Drilling Feature - Complete Implementation:
- Added Class/Drilling mode toggle at top of Add Class drawer (full-width segmented control)
- Drilling mode UI includes: date (defaults today), description, hours, location (Home/Gym toggle), style (Gi/NoGi)
- Class mode remains unchanged with full form
- Unified form spacing to 24px for consistency
- Fixed controlled/uncontrolled input warnings
- Drilling submissions marked with `classType: 'Drilling'` and include `drillingLocation` field
- Instructor field excluded from drilling submissions to prevent unintended defaults
- Added drilling hours visualization to monthly dashboard (dual-bar chart: indigo for classes, amber for drilling)
- Implemented metric pills in header: classes count, training hours, drilling hours, goal tracker
- All metric pills styled uniformly in gray (#f3f4f6)
- Empty months now display in gray with 0 values
- Fixed hydration errors by implementing client-only rendering for metric pills
- Form refactored to unified structure with visibility control via CSS display:none
