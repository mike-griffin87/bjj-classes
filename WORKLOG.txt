Branch: feature-drilling-hours

Drilling Feature - Complete Implementation:
- Added Class/Drilling mode toggle at top of Add Class drawer (full-width segmented control)
- Drilling mode UI includes: date (defaults today), description, hours, location (Home/Gym toggle), style (Gi/NoGi)
- Class mode remains unchanged with full form
- Unified form spacing to 24px for consistency
- Fixed controlled/uncontrolled input warnings
- Drilling submissions marked with `classType: 'Drilling'` and include `drillingLocation` field
- Instructor field excluded from drilling submissions to prevent unintended defaults
- Added drilling hours visualization to monthly dashboard (dual-bar chart: indigo for classes, amber for drilling)
- Implemented metric pills in header: classes count, training hours, drilling hours, goal tracker
- All metric pills styled uniformly in gray (#f3f4f6)
- Empty months now display in gray with 0 values
- Fixed hydration errors by implementing client-only rendering for metric pills
- Form refactored to unified structure with visibility control via CSS display:none

Branch: main

Bug Fixes & Security:
- Secured _prisma_migrations table with RLS policy (deny-all for public, service role bypasses)
- Fixed performance field not showing when editing existing classes (added to ClassRow type)
- Fixed "Invalid ID" error when updating classes (Next.js 15 params are now async Promises)
- Enhanced form state management to properly re-seed all fields when editing (performance, classTypes, techniques, instructor, style)

Performance Validation & Database Schema:
- Removed "None/N/A" option from performance selector (now only Bad, OK, Great)
- Made performance field required with default value of 'OK'
- Added client-side validation to prevent NULL performance submissions
- Updated database: converted all NULL and NONE performance values to 'OK'
- Removed NONE from Performance enum (now only BAD, OK, GREAT)
- Performance field is now NOT NULL in database with default 'OK'
- Performance notes field always visible (no longer conditional)
- Updated performance button grid from 4 columns to 3 columns
